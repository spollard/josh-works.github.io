## 4. Walkability is good for affordability in one crucial way, despite the premium you pay.

According to the study authors, the price (and thus tax-base) premium for walkable areas does not have to mean that such areas are exclusive or inaccessible to the majority of people, because living in such a place comes with its own benefit to the household bottom line: low transportation costs. This is reflected in the study’s “Social Equity Index”:

> It is counter-intuitive but the upper right hand corner of the scatterplot contains the metros with both the highest economic performance for their WalkUPs and the highest social equity for lower income households. 
> 
> While the “rent is too damn high” in nearly every metro for low income households, it is partially offset by lower household transportation costs. 
> 
> The majority of the WalkUPs in these six highest ranked metros (green dots) on both economic and social equity metrics have multiple transportation options, in addition to cars and trucks, which allow for lower income households to participate in society without maintaining a fleet of vehicles. 
> 
> By shifting household income from ownership and maintenance of automobiles (always depreciable assets) to housing (generally an appreciative asset), there is a far better opportunity to build household wealth. 
> 
> By dropping one car out of a household budget (AAA estimates the cost of car ownership averages $8,849 per year), a family can increase their mortgage capacity by approximately $150,000 at a 4 percent mortgage rate.
