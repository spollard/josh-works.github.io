## Featured Articles

Below this curated list is a full list of the ~240 posts available on my website. 

### Programming-related

I learn by writing things down, and refer to my own writing regularly to refresh my memory on how to do something. 

Here's a smattering of the programming-related posts I've written.

_note: I also run [https://intermediateruby.com/](https://intermediateruby.com/), where I'm helping early-career software developers grow as quickly as possible into mid-career software developers. If you think you might benefit from this, click the link and check it out!_

### Non-programming Miscelaneous 

"Programming" is a narrow domain. I vastly prefer to think of myself as a problem solver who sometimes uses code. Here's a collection of writings from the last ~10 years I've been writing. Most of it is from before I became a software developer.
