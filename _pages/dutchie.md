👋 Hi there, Dutchie. 

You've got a bunch of [open roles](https://dutchie.com/careers). Seventeen, as of October 13th. Most are in Engineering, but you've got a few Sales and Success roles. I _think_ I could be a good fit for one of the engineering roles, _or_ a role that doesn't quite exist.

I'm reaching out because I had a lovely call recently with Chris Hough, a very experienced software developer at Dutchie who works remotely from Boulder. He and I spoke mostly about his experience helping early-career software developers grow in their skills. This is a topic very near-and-dear to my heart. I run https://intermediateruby.com/, and am continying to add resources to help early-career software developers more quickly become solid "mid-level" developers[^intermediate-ruby-resources]. 

**TL;DR[^tldr]: I _might_ be able to deliver an incredible amount of value to Dutchie. The possible value is denominated in "millions of dollars a year", and is a function of me working closely with your core business units (Sales, Marketing, Support, Success, and Engineering) to make incremental improvements to each of those functions.**

Dutchie is a B2B SaaS, product-based company. This is exactly the space I work best.

I'm not sure of who the best person is to talk to about the potential. My strengths span sales, support, marketing, and engineering. I want to capitalize on opportunities to solve problems for Dutchie's customers _and_ employees, building trust all the while.

## Reasons I like Dutchie, which is related to reasons I can bring value to Dutchie

Here's some of the reasons I could bring substantial value to Dutchie.

- In the past, I've worked on or with sales, success, and support teams. I am as comfortable building/debugging features as I am discussing funnel conversion rate metrics with sales and marketing teams. 
- I've got extensive experience in the small-to-medium-size product-led B2B SaaS space.
- I've worked remotely in companies that are remote-first, _and_ I've worked remotely for companies that hardly have any remote work[^remote-work-covid].
I'm an enthusiastic supporter of the Marijuana legalization/decriminalization movement across the nation. (I live in Golden, CO, and benefit from it's legal status.)
- I am obsessed with team and organizational health. For Dutchie to keep solving big problems at scale, it needs to have healthy teams and high employee retention, so those with institutional knowledge stick around to keep shaping the institution. 

In growing companies, once they go about 60-70 employees, "coworker discoverability" becomes a challenge. When I was at a company of 150, I built bridges between groups who normally wouldn't talk to each other. When I was at a company of 2000, I did the exact same thing. 

## My Dream Role at Dutchie

Dutchie has lots of open roles, along the lines of `senior backend software developer`, or `senior full-stack software developer`. If I got to build my own role at Dutchie, it would be titled something like `Team Capacity Engineer` or ``

Software development is about solving problems at scale. Moving human process to processes machines can execute, freeing up the humans for more value-delivering work. 

I enable teams, and help groups build capacity to solve more problems faster with less effort. The teams I work on are left permanently improved, long after I'm gone. 

My dream role would be one where I get to spend time understanding the day-to-day operations of non-engineering functions of the business. In past roles, this sometimes looks like me spending a day with the support team, watching them use the product my team builds and maintains, to find ways to make it better for them. Since I've worked on a support team in the past, I can empathize with their day-to-day.

I've done the same thing with sales teams. I've worked on sales teams in the past, I know how challenging it can be. There are engineering contributions I can make that deliver time savings and better conversion rates for the sales teams, which eventually percolates down to making each individual on the sales team more effective and satisfied, while adding more value to each Dutchie customer. 

The teams I worked with became enthusiastic collaborators with me. When I left my last company, the director of support said he despaired of ever having such an effective and understanding software developer work with him again. 

I want to bring these kinds of cross-team collaborations to Dutchie. 



[^tldr]: An abbreviation for "Too Long; Didn't Read". Also known as "Executive Summary". 

[^intermediate-ruby-resources]: I've done things like [record pairing sessions with senior developers on OSS projects](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction), which I distill down into discrete lessons, to highlight [tacit knowledge](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction#what-is-tacit-knowledge). I've built an [obstacle course](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course) with resources on Redis, Sidekiq, Rubocop, Nokogiri, and more. 

[^remote-work-covid]: Post-covid, we're all _mostly_ remote workers, but communication patterns and remote/non-remote affinities is still critical. A team that is _thrilled_ to be working remotely will function differently than one where they all loved being in an office and now they're _forced_ to be remote. Or, where they all get to be in an office, and one or two of them is remote. [Conway's law] says (paraphrasing): "Organizations that design systems are constrainted to duplicate their own communication structures into that system". Conway's Law demonstrates why "bridge building" across departments is so important.
