Note from Josh: The following is an excerpt of chapter 34 of the Power Broker, called "Moses and the Mayors". The chapter is about Moses' relationship with all of the mayors of NYC that overlapped with his "rule" over NYC. 

This excerpt covers just one of the mayors' overlap with Moses' rule, but the way Moses wields his power over the mayor is absolute, and defies summarization. 

The following is an 11-page execerpt from _The Power Broker_, pages 787-798

# IMPY

All during August, Moses had been in South America, drawing up a Rockefeller-financed plan of improvements for São Paulo, utterly unaware of the events crushing in on O'Dwyer. But O'Dwyer's resignation was to place the city in his power more completely than ever before.

By law, the successor to a retiring mayor is the President of the City Council. By fate, the Council presidency was held in 1950 by an individual who, during the entire forty-five utterly undistinguished years of his life prior to his nomination to that $25,000-per-year 
post, had never been deemed worthy of holding any job more responsible than that of secretary, at $6,500 per year, to a judge named Schmuck.

The nomination of this totally unknown minor Tammany ward heeler to the city's second-highest elective office, the position of succession to the mayoralty, had "staggered," in Warren Moscow's words, "even the most imaginative among political reporters." And so had the explanation of how he had obtained the nomination. At a last-minute reshuffling of the 1945 Democratic ticket, the leaders finally agreed on Lazarus Joseph for Comptroller, and then realized that since O'Dwyer was Irish and from Brooklyn, while Joseph was Jewish and from the Bronx, the slate could have ethnic and geographic balance only if its third member was an Italian from Manhattan-and were unable to think of a single Manhattan Italian official they could trust. After hours of impasse, one leader reasoned that since legal secretaryships to State Supreme Court justices carried a respectable salary for which little or no work was required, they would have been given oply "safest" of Democratic workers. 

Pulling out a little "Green Book," the official directory of city employees, he turned to the list of legal secretaries, ran his finger down it looking for a name that even the dumbest voter be able to tell was Italian-and came to Vincent R. Impellitteri, "No one
knew who the hell he was," Reuben Lazarus was to recall, but, looking up Impellitteri's address, the leaders determined that he lived in Manhattan, telephoned his district leader and were assured: "You don't have to worry about him. He's a good boy."

Although attested to privately by members of Tammany's hierarchy (and by Moses, whose presence at the crucial ticket-making session - he was the only "outsider" there - reveals his standing with that hierarchy), this explanation seemed almost unbelievable - until one met Impellitteri. 

If he had a single qualification for the job other than the length of his name and the fact that it ended in a vowel, he kept it carefully hidden during his five-year tenure (he was re-elected with O'Dwyer in 1949) as Council President. "The perfect Throttlebottom," Moscow called him. "He voted as the mayor told him to, on matters he did not necessarily understand, and spent most of his waking hours shaking hands at public dinners, political clambakes, and cornerstone layings too unimportant to merit the mayor's presence." 

Amiable but slow-witted, he was a joke among political insiders. But now he was mayor - and the joke was on the city.

Impellitteri's wits may have been slow, but he had two fast wits - ex-O'Dwyer aide Bill Donoghue and a young sharpie named Sydney S. Baron -- as PR men. 

Impellitteri had to run in a special election in November if he wanted to hold the office he had fallen into, which meant that he had less than ten weeks in which to create an image and a record, and his PR men quickly hit on two ways to do it: 
- first, take advantage of the fact that no one knew him, that he was therefore not identified with any political bosses, that his opponent, Ferdinand Pecora, was backed by Tammany boss DeSapio and that unable to get Impellitteri the Democratic nomination, the clique in Tammany that pulled his strings had him running as an independent, and portray him as the "anti-boss," "anti-politician," "anti-corrupttion" candidate (one of Baron's better lines: "If Pecora is elected, Frank Costello will be your mayor. But the voice will be that of Pecora"); 
- second, identify him with Robert Moses.

The price of that identification came high, both in specifics - Moses

------------------------

made Impellitteri pledge publicly that if he was elected, he would not re-
appoint Finkelstein - and in generalities: Impellitteri privately promised
Moses even more of a free hand than he had enjoyed under O'Dwyer in
setting all city construction policies. But Impellitteri paid it. He got full
value in return. Refusing an offer of the Republican nomination (time had
dimmed at least some GOP leaders' memories of 1934), Moses gave him his
endorsement. "Even I, who thought that by this time I knew Bob and the
lengths to which he would go, never thought he would go that far," says
Lazarus. Remonstrating, he said, "But, Bob, he hasn't any capacity for the
job at all!"

Moses' response? "He laughed at that." Publicly, the Coordinator
declared that Impellitteri "has shown extraordinary courage and indepen-
dence." And, as always, a Moses endorsement made almostc
in town. (The Herald Tribune article stated: "It was not a political endorse-

edit and front-page pictures for-highways and housing projects with which

to documents his aides say he often had not even bothered to read. Most
chservers, noting that the campaign consisted mainly of charges and counter-
terges of bossism and corruption, felt that the endorsement from an official
characterized as "independent" and believed above corruption was an im-
nortant factor-almost as important as the decision by newspaper headline
writers to call him "Impy" and thus give him a lovable public image-in Im-
pellitteri's victory, the first in the city's history by a candidate running on an
independent line without the support of either major party. And after his
election, Impellitteri continued to pay the price-eagerly.

race, but once in possession of the prize he had won, he proved to have

He disclaimed any influence over the Board of Estimate, telling re-
porters, "All I have is three votes on it, you know." Mayors were always
telling reporters that-but City Hall insiders soon realized, to their astonish-
ment, that this mayor believed it. Says one of his aides, Victor F. Condello:
