You purchased something!

This is probably a way bigger deal to me than it is to you. I love to build useful things, but I try to work in a minimum-increment-of-usefulness of "meaningful amount of money".

That means try to work on problems that are painful enough that someone will pay for a solution.

I'm _thrilled_ that you did that. I'm pretty confident that you'll be thrilled with what you purchased, but I'm honored and humbled that you've chosen to give _me_, this random guy on the internet, your hard-earned cash. 

There's a few different purchase options that will leave you on this page.

You might receive an automatic email from me in the next few minutes. If it's more of a one-off project, you'll get a personal email from me next time I'm at my laptop.

If you get an email from me, it'll be from `thompsonjoshd@gmail.com` or `josh@josh.works`.

Obviously, if you have any questions, or don't see your email after fifteen minutes, just shoot me an email. I'll sort it out.
